# ðŸ“ˆ Stock Analysis Module

## Purpose
This module performs advanced pattern recognition and momentum analysis on stock data to identify trends, predict future price movements, and discover correlations between multiple stocks.

## What It Does
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identifies recurring patterns in stock price movements
- **Momentum Analysis**: Tracks velocity and acceleration of price changes
- **Multi-Stock Correlation**: Finds relationships between different stocks
- **Time Series Forecasting**: Projects future price movements based on historical data
- **Direction Prediction**: Determines likely short and long-term price direction

## Core Analysis Types

### 1. Single Stock Analysis
- Price momentum indicators
- Support/resistance levels
- Trend identification
- Volume patterns

### 2. Multi-Stock Analysis
- Cross-correlation between stocks
- Sector momentum tracking
- Market-wide pattern detection
- Portfolio optimization signals

### 3. Time Series Analysis
- ARIMA modeling
- Seasonal decomposition
- Volatility clustering
- Mean reversion detection

## Architecture
The analysis module connects to the existing Amplify backend and Finnhub data services to fetch real-time and historical stock data, then applies various analytical models to generate insights.
